# To-Do Task Manager with FastAPI and Streamlit

ðŸš€ **A fully functional To-Do Task Manager built with FastAPI (backend) and Streamlit (frontend).**

This project demonstrates how to build a **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application using modern Python frameworks. The backend is powered by **FastAPI**, while the frontend is built with **Streamlit** for an interactive user experience. The application uses **SQLite** for database storage and **SQLAlchemy** for database management.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**:
  - Create, read, update, and delete tasks effortlessly.
- **FastAPI Backend**:
  - RESTful API with endpoints for managing tasks.
  - Automatic Swagger UI documentation.
